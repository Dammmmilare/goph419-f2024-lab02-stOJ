"""
Create a tests.py file that will contain any unit tests that you implement for 
your functions in your module file. You are encouraged to write the tests early 
(even before your implement your module functions) and run them each time 
you change the code to implement a new feature or fix a bug. Each unit test 
function should have a name like test_XYZ() where XYZ is the name of the 
function being tested. You may also choose to implement other functions that 
help to setup and tear down similar unit tests. All tests should be called from 
the
 if __name__ == "__main__":
 guard at the bottom of the file and when the tests.py file is run as a script it 
should print some brief output of each test and whether it passed or failed.
